          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          Currently, machine learning inference in the browser uses the WebGL
          graphics API with limited or no access to platform capabilities
          beneficial for ML such as CPU parallelism, general-purpose GPU, or
          dedicated ML hardware accelerators.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposed Web API aims to expose generic capabilities to the Web
          required to provide close-to-native machine learning performance in
          the browser. In addition to the performance benefits, inference in
          the browser as opposed to in the cloud enhances privacy, since input
          data such as locally sourced images or video streams stay within the
          browser's sandbox. Local processing also enables machine learning use
          cases that require low latency, such as object detection in immersive
          web experiences.

            The scope is limited to development of interfaces that expose
            inference capabilities of the modern platforms beneficial or
            purpose-built for ML. Training capabilities are out of scope due to
            limited availability of respective platform APIs.

          Most Web Machine Learning Working Group teleconferences will focus on
          discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an
          as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on GitHub issues.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for
          administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and
          members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases
          when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process
          Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant
          makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
          little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus
          is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views
          presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision
          along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from
          one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of
          the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the
          end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have
          consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the
          discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document
          (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond
          what the Process Document requires.
